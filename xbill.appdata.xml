         Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right? You're a sysadmin,
         and someone's trying to destroy your computers. The little people
         running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with
         Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular
         operating system. Your objective is to click the mouse on them, 
         ending the potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a 
         computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the
         virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with
         your vital software.
